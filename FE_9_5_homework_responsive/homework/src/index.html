                            In reality both sides of the Moon see the same amount of sunlight
                            however only one face of the Moon is ever seen from Earth. This is
                            because the Moon rotates around on its own axis in exactly the same
                            time it takes to orbit the Earth, meaning the same side is always facing
                            the Earth. The side facing away from Earth has only been seen by the
                            human eye from spacecraft

                        <p>
                            There are two bulges in the Earth due to the gravitational pull that
                            the Moon exerts; one on the side facing the Moon, and the other on
                            the opposite side that faces away from the Moon, The bulges move
                            around the oceans as the Earth rotates, causing high and low tides
                            around the globe.

                        <p>
                            The Moon is moving approximately 3.8 cm away from our planet
                            every year. It is estimated that it will continue to do so for around 50
                            billion years. By the time that happens, the Moon will be taking around
                            47 days to orbit the Earth instead of the current 27.3 days.

                        <p>
                            The Moon has much weaker gravity than Earth, due to its smaller
                            mass, so you would weigh about one sixth (16.5%) of your weight on
                            Earth. This

                        <p>
                            The first man to set foot on the Moon in 1969 was Neil Armstrong
                            on the Apollo 11 mission, while the last man to walk on the Moon in
                            1972 was Gene Cernan on the Apollo 17 mission. Since then the
                            Moon has only be visited by unmanned vehicles.

                        <p>
                            This means that the surface of the Moon is unprotected from
                            cosmic rays, meteorites and solar winds, and has huge temperature
                            variations. The lack of atmosphere means no sound can be heard on
                            the Moon, and the sky always appears black.

                            These are caused by the gravitational pull of the Earth. Lunar
                            astronauts used seismographs on their visits to the Moon, and found
                            that small moonquakes occurred several kilometres beneath the
                            surface, causing ruptures and cracks. Scientists think the Moon has a
                            molten core, just like Earth.

                            all goes according to plan.
